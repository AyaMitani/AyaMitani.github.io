I completed my PhD in [Biostatistics](https://www.bu.edu/sph/about/departments/biostatistics/) at Boston University under the advisement of [Professor Kerrie Nelson](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/kerrie-nelson/). 

My research interests include: Methods for correlated data, informative cluster size, missing data; Methods for assessing agreement; Applications to cancer, dental, screening and diagnostic studies. 

During my PhD, I was awarded an individual predoctoral fellowship ([F31](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships/F31)) from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. I was able to dedicate 100% of my time to dissertation research without the responsibility of being an RA or a TA. This gave me the flexibiliy to work on my dissertation at my own pace and the ability to complete additional training. Moreover, the grant comes with a pretty generous fund for travel, books and equipment. I'm happy to share about my experience in applying for the F31 with anyone who is interested.
