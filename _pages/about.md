I am Assistant Professor in the [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/division/biostatistics/) at [University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/).

In June 2019, I completed my PhD in [Biostatistics](https://www.bu.edu/sph/about/departments/biostatistics/) at Boston University under the advisement of [Professor Kerrie Nelson](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/kerrie-nelson/). Following my PhD, I did a postdoctoral research fellowship with [Professor Sebastien Haneuse](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/sebastien-haneuse/) in the [Department of Biostatisitcs](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health.

So far, my research has focused on methods for correlated data, informative cluster size, missing data and methods for assessing agreement. I have collaborated with researchers from various disciplines including oncology, nephrology, anesthesiology, and dental medicine. 

During my PhD, I was awarded an individual predoctoral fellowship ([F31](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships/F31)) from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. I was able to dedicate 100% of my time to dissertation research without the responsibility of being an RA or a TA. This gave me the flexibility to work on my dissertation at my own pace and the ability to complete additional training. Moreover, I was able to attend multiple conferences and buy books and computer equipment through the pretty generous allowance that comes with the grant. I highly recommend PhD students to apply for their own funding, especially if they want to remain in academia. I'm happy to share my experience in applying for the F31 with anyone who is interested.
