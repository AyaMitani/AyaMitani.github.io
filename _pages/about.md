I completed my PhD in Biostatistics at Boston University under the advisement of [Professor Kerrie Nelson](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/kerrie-nelson/). 

During my PhD, I was awarded an individual predoctoral fellowship (F31) from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. I'm happy to share about my experience in applying for the F31 with anyone who is interested.
