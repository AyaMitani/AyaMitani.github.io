- [CWGEE](https://github.com/AyaMitani/CWGEE): Cluster-weighted generalized estimating equations for clustered longitudinal data with informative cluster size

- [ipccwGEE](https://github.com/AyaMitani/ipccwGEE): Solves the cluster-weighted generalized estimating equations with inverse probability censoring weights for correlated binary responses in clustered longitudinal data with informative cluster size and informative drop-out.

- [modelkappa](https://github.com/AyaMitani/modelkappa): Calculates model-based kappa of agreement and association and their standard errors for multiple raters each assessing multiple cases
